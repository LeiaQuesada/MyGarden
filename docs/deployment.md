# Deployment

This project is set up to deploy to [Heroku][], using the [Container stack][].

## Prerequisites

The [prerequisites to deploy to Heorku][prerequisites] is the same as the local
development environment.

You'll also need to [setup up the `.env` file][dotenv] in your project
directory.

## Setup

1. [Sign up for a Heroku account][sign up] if you don't already have one.
1. [Install the Heroku CLI][cli]. On macOS:

   ```sh
   brew tap heroku/brew && brew install heroku
   ```

1. Set up an app:

   ```sh
   npm run heroku:setup
   ```

   You may be asked to login so the Heroku CLI can perform tasks in your
   account.

   At the end of the process (which will take about 5 minutes), you'll be shown
   the details of your app, including the URL of where you can access the app.

   You should see the app running in your browser. If not, just visit the URL.

## Deployment

As you make code changes to the server or the app, you can always deploy your
current working branch to see it running at Heroku:

```sh
npm run heroku:deploy
```

### Automatic Deployment

This repo also contains a [GitHub Actions][] deployment workflow. Any new
commits to the `main` branch will trigger the workflow.

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: You still need to run the [Heroku setup step](#setup) before
you can automatically deploy.

1. Create a Heroku API token:

   ```sh
   heroku authorizations:create -d "GitHub Actions"
   ```

   Copy the "Token" value.

1. Add the following [GitHub repository secrets][repo-secrets]:
   - `HEROKU_API_KEY`: the Heorku authorization token
   - `HEROKU_APP_NAME`: the Heroku app name (`heroku apps` if you forgot it)

From now on, whenever you push or merge into the `main` branch, GitHub will
automatically deploy the branch to Heroku! üôå
